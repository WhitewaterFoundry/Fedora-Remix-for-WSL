# Fedora Remix for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Fedora Remix for WSL is a remix of upstream [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) software for [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://github.com/sirredbeard/Awesome-WSL) on Windows 10 and Windows 10 Server.

Fedora Remix for WSL is powered by [Pengwin Enterprise](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/WLE) from [Whitewater Foundry](https://www.whitewaterfoundry.com/). Fedora Remix for WSL is not endorsed by the Fedora Project or Red Hat, Inc. but is provided under the [Fedora Remix](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Remix) program.

Fedora Remix for WSL contains modifications to the official Fedora distribution. The unmodified Fedora distribution can be obtained [here](https://getfedora.org/). Fedora Remix for WSL does not include pengwin-setup or other [features](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/Pengwin#features) of [Pengwin](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/Pengwin).

Fedora Remix for WSL is provided on a community-support basis. There is no support available for Fedora Remix for WSL from the Fedora community other than that which is offered to all users.

- The following packages have been removed from the default install of Fedora Remix for WSL: `grub`, `plymouth`, `kernel`, `sssd`, `linux-firmware`, `dracut`, `parted`, `e2fsprogs`, `iprutils`, `ppc64-utils`, `selinux-policy`, `policycoreutils`, `sendmail`, `firewalld`, `fedora-release`, `fedora-logos`, and `fedora-release-notes`.
- The following non-default package has been added to the default install to comply with the Fedora Remix program's terms: `generic-release`.
- The following configuration files have custom settings applied for the WSL environment: `/etc/wsl.conf`, `/etc/local.conf`, and `/etc/profile`.
- The following files have been removed and will be automatically re-generated if/as needed: `/etc/resolv.conf`, `/boot`, and `/var/cache/dnf/*`.

### Whitewater Foundry, Ltd. Co.

[Whitewater Foundry, Ltd. Co.](https://www.whitewaterfoundry.com/) is an open-source startup that created Pengwin (formerly WLinux), the first Linux distribution designed for Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows 10. Pengwin has since become a top developer tool on the Microsoft Store, and Whitewater Foundry has grown to a worldwide team of independent developers. Whitewater Foundry recently debuted Pengwin Enterprise and joined the Red Hat Business Partners program to offer a customizable, secure, and reliable WSL solution for large organizations powered by Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

### Isn't Fedora free?

Yes, Fedora is free. You should [go get it](https://getfedora.org/) and use it on your Linux workstation. We at Whitewater Foundry love Fedora and use it. Fedora Remix for WSL is not Fedora, though; it is a [remix](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Remix). The remix program allows individuals, groups, and companies to make Fedora derivatives for particular purposes that may contain modified/non-Fedora software. For example, there is the [Russian Fedora Remix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Fedora_Remix), [FedBerry](https://github.com/fedberry), and [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/). We at Whitewater Foundry saw the demand for a Fedora distro for WSL. With [no official Fedora for WSL coming](https://twitter.com/mattdm/status/1058417653918896131), we invested the time and resources into making the Fedora Remix for WSL available as an alternative, building on our premium Pengwin Enterprise codebase. We charge for the official download through the Microsoft Store to continue optimizing, building, and packaging Fedora Remix for WSL, paying open-source developers, and building a sustainable open-source venture. Unlike Pengwin and Pengwin Enterprise, though, we also make signed downloads of Fedora Remix for WSL [available via GitHub](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/WSLFedoraRemix/releases) that can be side-loaded for free.
